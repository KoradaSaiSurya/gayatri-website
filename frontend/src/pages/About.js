      <h1>About Sri Chaitanya High School</h1>

           <section className="about-section">
      <p>
        <strong>Sri Chaitanya High School</strong> is not just a place for learning — it is a temple of knowledge, values, and dreams.
        Established with a vision to shape young minds into future leaders, our school has been consistently delivering
        quality education for over <strong>15+ years</strong> in Andhra Pradesh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our campus is a vibrant, welcoming space where students feel safe, motivated, and inspired to reach their full potential.
        With modern classrooms, digital learning tools, science & computer labs, playgrounds, and a library,
        we create an environment that encourages both academic excellence and personal growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the heart of Sri Chaitanya are our <strong>experienced, qualified, and caring faculty members</strong> who treat every student like their own child.
        Our teachers focus on building not just subject knowledge, but also confidence, discipline, curiosity, and moral values.
        We believe that every child is unique and deserves the opportunity to shine.
      </p>

      <p>
        We follow a balanced academic curriculum that combines the Andhra Pradesh State Board syllabus with co-curricular activities
        like sports, arts, cultural events, quiz competitions, yoga, and leadership programs. Our students don’t just pass exams —
        they learn life skills, teamwork, and problem-solving that prepares them for the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Parents are our biggest partners in the journey of education. We ensure <strong>regular communication</strong> through parent-teacher meetings,
        digital updates, and performance reports. Transparency, trust, and collaboration are our foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are proud of our 100% SSC pass results, top ranks, and success stories of our alumni who are now doctors, engineers,
        civil servants, entrepreneurs, and most importantly, responsible citizens of India.
      </p>

      <p>
        Join us on this mission to build a brighter future — one student at a time.  
        <strong>Sri Chaitanya High School</strong> is where learning begins, and dreams take flight. 🚀
